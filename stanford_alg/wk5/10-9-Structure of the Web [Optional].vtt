WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:02.525
So, we've now put in a lot
of work designing and

2
00:00:02.525 --> 00:00:05.970
analyzing super fast algorithms for
reasoning about graphs.

3
00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.550
So in this optional video,
what I want to do is show you why you

4
00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.200
might want such a primitive, especially
for computation on extremely large graphs.

5
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.640
Specifically, we're going to look at the
results of a famous study that computes

6
00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.449
the strongly connected
components of the web graph.

7
00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:21.510
So what is the web graph?

8
00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.475
Well it's the graph in which
the vertices correspond to webpages.

9
00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.830
So for example I have my own webpage
where I list my research papers and

10
00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:32.600
also links to courses, such as this one.

11
00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:37.270
And the edges are going to be directed and
they correspond precisely to hyperlinks.

12
00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:39.760
So the links that bring you
from one web page to another.

13
00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.790
Note, of course, these are directed edges,

14
00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.720
where the tail is the page
that contains the hyperlink.

15
00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:49.140
And the head is the page that you
go to if you click the hyperlink.

16
00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.300
And so, this is a directed graph.

17
00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:57.130
So from my home page you can get to
my papers, you can get to my courses.

18
00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:01.950
Sometimes I have random links up to things
I like, say, my favorite record store.

19
00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:03.670
And of course for many of these webpages,

20
00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:06.080
there are additional links going out or
going in.

21
00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.510
So for example, from my papers I
might link to some of my co-authors.

22
00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:14.240
Some of my co-authors might be
linking from their homepages to me.

23
00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.860
Or of course, there's webpages out there
which list the currently available

24
00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:20.490
free online courses and so on.

25
00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.610
So obviously,
this is just part of a massive web graph,

26
00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:25.930
just a tiny, tiny piece of it.

27
00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:30.660
So the origins of the web were
probably around 1990 or so, but

28
00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:33.730
it started to really
explode in the mid 90s.

29
00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:37.350
And by the year 2000, it was sort
of already beyond comprehension.

30
00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.390
Even though, in Internet years,

31
00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.940
the year 2000 is sort of the stone age,
relative to right now, relative to 2012.

32
00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:46.589
But still, even by 2000 people were so

33
00:01:46.589 --> 00:01:49.901
overwhelmed with the massive
scale of the web graph,

34
00:01:49.901 --> 00:01:54.551
they wanted to understand anything
about it, even the most basic things.

35
00:01:54.551 --> 00:01:57.323
Now of course, one issue with
understanding what the graph looks like is

36
00:01:57.323 --> 00:01:58.920
you don't even have it locally, right?

37
00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.270
It's distributed over all of these
different servers over the entire world.

38
00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:04.930
So the first thing people
really focused on,

39
00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:07.940
when the wanted to answer this question,
was on techniques for crawling.

40
00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:11.810
So having software which just
follows lots of hyperlinks,

41
00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:14.910
reports back to the home base,
from which you can assemble

42
00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.650
at least some kind of sketch of
what this graph actually is.

43
00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:21.210
But then the question is, even once
you have this crawled information,

44
00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:25.970
even once you've accessed a good chunk of
the nodes and the edges of this network,

45
00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.200
what does it look like?

46
00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.040
So what makes this a difficult question,
more difficult than, say, for

47
00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.180
any other directed graph
you might encounter?

48
00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:38.380
Well, it's simply the massive scale
of the web graph, it's just so big.

49
00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:41.799
So for the graph used in the particular
study I'm going to discuss, like we said,

50
00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:45.291
it was in the year 2000, which is sort
of the stone age compared to 2012.

51
00:02:45.291 --> 00:02:51.740
So the graph was small, relatively, but
still the graph was really, really big.

52
00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:55.005
So it was something like
200 million nodes and

53
00:02:55.005 --> 00:02:56.840
one billion edges, really one and
a half billion edges.

54
00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:02.740
So the reference for the work I'm going to
discuss is a paper by a number of authors.

55
00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:06.430
The first author is Andre Broder and
then he has many co-authors and

56
00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:10.170
this was a paper that appeared in
the WWW Conference of the year 2000,

57
00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.120
that's the World Wide Web Conference.

58
00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.740
And I encourage to those of you who
are interested to go track down

59
00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:17.530
the paper online and
read the original source.

60
00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:18.280
So Andre Broder,

61
00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.560
the lead author, at this time he was at
a company that was called Alta Vista.

62
00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.750
So how many of you remember
a company called Alta Vista?

63
00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:28.320
Well, some of you,

64
00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:32.320
especially the youngest ones among you
maybe have never heard of Alta Vista.

65
00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:35.690
And the youngest ones among you
maybe can't even conceive of a world

66
00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:37.550
in which we didn't have Google.

67
00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:42.476
But in fact, there was a time when we had
web search, but Google did not yet exist.

68
00:03:42.476 --> 00:03:48.130
That was sort of in the maybe '97 or so,
and so this is in the very embryonic

69
00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:52.018
years of Google, and this data set
actually came out of Alta Vista instead.

70
00:03:52.018 --> 00:03:55.550
So Broder et al wanted to get
some answers to this question,

71
00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:56.810
what does this web graph look like?

72
00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:58.630
And they approached it in a few ways.

73
00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:01.350
But the one I'm going to focus on here is,
they asked, well,

74
00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:07.390
what's the most detailed structure
we can get about this web graph,

75
00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:09.980
without doing an infeasible
amount of computation?

76
00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:14.620
Really just sticking to linear
time algorithms, at the worst.

77
00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:15.350
And, what have we seen?

78
00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:19.070
We've seen that in a directed graph you
can get full connectivity information

79
00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:20.718
just really using depth first search.

80
00:04:20.718 --> 00:04:24.020
That you can compute strongly
connected components in linear time

81
00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:25.320
with small constants.

82
00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.230
And that's one of the major things
that they did in this study.

83
00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:31.380
Now if you wanted to do
the same computation today,

84
00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:34.270
you'd have one thing going against you and
one thing going for you.

85
00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:37.200
The obvious thing that you'd have going
against you is that the web is still very

86
00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:42.240
much bigger than it was here,
certainly by an order of magnitude.

87
00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:47.260
The thing that you'd have going for you
is now there's specialized systems which

88
00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:50.020
are meant to operate on massive data sets.

89
00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:50.580
And in particular,

90
00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:53.800
they can do things like compute
connectivity information on graph data.

91
00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:57.498
So what you have to remember, for
those of you who are aware of these terms,

92
00:04:57.498 --> 00:05:00.390
in 2000 there was no MapReduce,
there was no Hadoop.

93
00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:03.360
There were no tools for
automated processing large data sets,

94
00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:05.440
these guys really had
to do it from scratch.

95
00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:12.155
So let me tell you about what Broder et al
found when they did strong connectivity

96
00:05:12.155 --> 00:05:15.064
computations on the web graph.

97
00:05:15.064 --> 00:05:19.740
They explain their results in what they
called the bow tie picture of the web.

98
00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:22.760
So let's begin with the center,
or the knot of the bow tie.

99
00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:27.436
So in the middle we have what we're
going to call a giant strongly connected

100
00:05:27.436 --> 00:05:28.287
component.

101
00:05:32.049 --> 00:05:35.881
With the interpretation being this is
the core of the web in some sense.

102
00:05:40.404 --> 00:05:43.220
All right, so all of you know
what an SCC is at this point.

103
00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:46.400
A strongly connected component is a region
from which you can get from any point to

104
00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:47.961
any other point along a directed path.

105
00:05:47.961 --> 00:05:51.988
So in the context of the web graph, with
this giant SCC, what this means is that

106
00:05:51.988 --> 00:05:56.384
from any webpage inside this blob, you can
get to any other webpage inside this blob,

107
00:05:56.384 --> 00:05:58.790
just by traversing
a sequence of hyperlinks.

108
00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:04.270
And hopefully it doesn't strike you as too
surprising that a big chunk of the web

109
00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:07.300
is strongly connected,
is well-connected in this sense, right?

110
00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:10.533
So if you think about all the different
universities in the world,

111
00:06:10.533 --> 00:06:14.574
probably all of the webpages corresponding
to all of the different universities,

112
00:06:14.574 --> 00:06:16.959
you can get from any one
place to any other place.

113
00:06:16.959 --> 00:06:21.140
For example, from the homepage on which I
put my papers, I often include links to my

114
00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:24.390
co-authors, which very commonly
are at other universities.

115
00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:29.180
So that already provides a web link from
some Stanford page to some page at say,

116
00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:31.610
Berkeley or Cornell or whatever.

117
00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:32.930
And of course, I'm just one person,

118
00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:35.170
I'm just one of many faculty
members at Stanford.

119
00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:39.930
So you put all of these together,
you would expect all of the different SCCs

120
00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:43.180
corresponding to different universities
to collapse into a single one.

121
00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:46.700
And so on for other sectors as well.

122
00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:49.780
And then of course, if you knew that
a huge chunk of the web was in the same

123
00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:51.320
strongly connected component,

124
00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:54.900
so let's say 10% of the web, which
would be tens of millions of webpages.

125
00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:56.599
You wouldn't expect there
to be a second one, right?

126
00:06:56.599 --> 00:07:01.390
It would be super weird if there were two
different blobs, 10 million web pages

127
00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:05.310
each that somehow were not mutually
reachable from each other.

128
00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:09.370
All it takes to collapse two
SCCs into one is a lone arc

129
00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:12.390
going from one to the other and then
a lone arc going in the reverse direction.

130
00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:14.650
And then those two SCCs collapse into one.

131
00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:16.920
So we do expect a giant SCC,

132
00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:19.900
just sort of thinking anecdotally
about what the web looks like.

133
00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:21.800
And then once we realize
there's one giant SCC,

134
00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:23.130
we don't expect there to be more than one.

135
00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:25.030
All right, so is that the whole story?

136
00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:27.730
Is the web graph just one big SCC?

137
00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:31.340
Well, one of the perhaps interesting
findings of this Broder et al paper

138
00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:35.910
is that there is a giant SCC, but it
doesn't actually take up the whole web, or

139
00:07:35.910 --> 00:07:38.890
anything really that
close to the entire web.

140
00:07:38.890 --> 00:07:41.090
So what else would there
be in such a picture?

141
00:07:41.090 --> 00:07:45.480
Well, there's the other two ends of
the bow tie, which are called the in and

142
00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:46.140
the out regions.

143
00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:51.430
In the out regions you have a bunch
of strongly connected components,

144
00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:52.970
not giant SCCs.

145
00:07:52.970 --> 00:07:55.670
We've established their shouldn't
be any other giant SCCs.

146
00:07:55.670 --> 00:08:00.960
But small SCCs, which you can reach from
the giant strongly connected component.

147
00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:04.950
But from which you cannot go back to
the giant strongly connected component.

148
00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:12.750
I encourage you to think about what types
of websites you would expect to see

149
00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:14.330
in this out part of the bow tie.

150
00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:15.890
I'll give you one example.

151
00:08:15.890 --> 00:08:19.510
Very often if you look at a corporate
site, including those of well known

152
00:08:19.510 --> 00:08:24.230
corporations, which you would definitely
expect to be reachable from the giant SCC.

153
00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:28.630
It's actually a corporate policy that
no hyperlinks can go from something in

154
00:08:28.630 --> 00:08:31.910
the corporate site to something
outside the corporate site.

155
00:08:31.910 --> 00:08:34.720
So that means the corporate site is
going to be a collection of webpages,

156
00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:36.330
which is certainly strongly connected.

157
00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:40.420
Because it's a major corporation, you can
certainly get there from the giant SCC.

158
00:08:40.420 --> 00:08:42.680
But because of its corporate policy,
you can't get back out.

159
00:08:43.950 --> 00:08:46.480
Symmetrically, in the in
part of the bow tie,

160
00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:50.140
you have strongly connected components,
generally small ones.

161
00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:52.850
From which you can reach the giant SCC,
but

162
00:08:52.850 --> 00:08:55.310
you cannot get to them from the giant SCC.

163
00:08:57.110 --> 00:09:00.060
Again, I encourage you to think about all
the different types of webpages you might

164
00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:02.945
expect to see in this
in part of the bow tie.

165
00:09:02.945 --> 00:09:06.180
Certainly I think one really obvious
example would be new webpages.

166
00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:09.620
So if you just create something, and
then if I just created a webpage and

167
00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:14.290
pointed it to Stanford University, that
would immediately be in this in component

168
00:09:14.290 --> 00:09:15.620
or this in collection of components.

169
00:09:16.910 --> 00:09:17.590
Now, if you think about it,

170
00:09:17.590 --> 00:09:21.710
this does not exhaust all of
the possibilities of where nodes can lie.

171
00:09:21.710 --> 00:09:25.420
There's a few other cases that frankly
are pretty weird, but they're there.

172
00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:30.860
You can have passive hyperlinks,
which bypass the giant SCC and

173
00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:37.056
go straight from the in part of
the bow tie to the out part.

174
00:09:37.056 --> 00:09:42.200
So Broder et al suggested
calling these tubes.

175
00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:47.000
And then there's also a kind of very
curious outgrowths going out of the in

176
00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.780
component, but which don't make
it all the way to the giant SCC.

177
00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:54.640
And similarly, there's stuff which
goes into the out component.

178
00:09:55.840 --> 00:10:00.730
And Broder et al recommended calling
these strange creatures tendrils.

179
00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:07.890
And then, in fact,
you can just have some weird

180
00:10:07.890 --> 00:10:13.400
isolated islands of SCCs that are not
connected, even weakly, to the giant SCC.

181
00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:18.130
So this is the picture that
emerged from Broder et al's strong

182
00:10:18.130 --> 00:10:20.610
component computation on the web graph.

183
00:10:20.610 --> 00:10:24.060
And here's, qualitatively, some of
the main findings that they came up with.

184
00:10:26.140 --> 00:10:30.640
So first of all, that picture on the
previous slide I drew roughly to scale.

185
00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:35.591
In the sense that all four parts,
so the giant SCC, the in part,

186
00:10:35.591 --> 00:10:40.912
the out part, and then the residual stuff,
the tubes and tendrils,

187
00:10:40.912 --> 00:10:46.640
have roughly the same size, more or
less 25% of the nodes in the graph.

188
00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:50.161
I think this is surprising people.

189
00:10:50.161 --> 00:10:53.026
I think some people might
have thought that the core,

190
00:10:53.026 --> 00:10:57.240
that the giant SCC might have been
a little bit bigger than just 25 or 28%.

191
00:10:57.240 --> 00:11:00.935
But it turns out there's a lot of
other stuff outside of this strongly

192
00:11:00.935 --> 00:11:01.900
connected core.

193
00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:07.923
You might wonder if this is just
an artifact of this data set

194
00:11:07.923 --> 00:11:11.004
being from the stone age,
being from 2000 or so.

195
00:11:11.004 --> 00:11:17.010
But people have rerun this experiment
on the web graph again in later years.

196
00:11:17.010 --> 00:11:20.130
And of course the numbers are changing
because the graph is growing rapidly.

197
00:11:20.130 --> 00:11:24.620
But these qualitative findings
have seemed pretty stable

198
00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:28.220
throughout subsequent reevaluations
of the structure of the web.

199
00:11:30.550 --> 00:11:34.520
On the other hand, while the core of
the web is not as big as you might have

200
00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:36.740
expected, it's extremely well connected.

201
00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:39.080
Perhaps better connected then
you might have expected.

202
00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:41.620
Now you'd be right to ask the question,

203
00:11:41.620 --> 00:11:43.630
what could I mean by
unusually well connected?

204
00:11:43.630 --> 00:11:47.900
We've already established that this giant
core of the web is strongly connected.

205
00:11:47.900 --> 00:11:51.470
You can get from any one place to any
other place via a sequence of hyperlinks.

206
00:11:51.470 --> 00:11:52.880
What else could you want?

207
00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:56.610
Well in fact, it has a very richer
notion of connectivity called the small

208
00:11:56.610 --> 00:11:57.640
world property.

209
00:11:57.640 --> 00:11:59.800
So let me tell you about
the small world property or

210
00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:03.390
the phenomenon colloquially known
as six degrees of separation.

211
00:12:03.390 --> 00:12:08.060
So this is an idea that had been in the
air at least since the early 20th century,

212
00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:13.030
but really kind of was studied in a major
way and popularized by Stanley Milgram,

213
00:12:13.030 --> 00:12:16.540
who's a social scientist, back in 1967.

214
00:12:16.540 --> 00:12:20.640
So, Milgram was interested in
understanding, are people at great

215
00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:24.520
distance, in fact, connected by
a short change of intermediaries?

216
00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:28.360
So, the way he evaluated this,
he ran the following experiment.

217
00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:33.850
He identified a friend in Boston,
Massachusetts, a doctor, I believe.

218
00:12:33.850 --> 00:12:36.190
And so this was going to be the target.

219
00:12:36.190 --> 00:12:40.280
And then he identified a bunch of
people who were thought to be far away,

220
00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:44.540
both culturally and geographically,
specifically Omaha.

221
00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:46.300
So for
those of you who don't live in the US,

222
00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:50.310
just take it on faith that many people
in the US would regard Boston and

223
00:12:50.310 --> 00:12:54.500
Omaha as being fairly far apart,
geographically and otherwise.

224
00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:59.450
And what did is he wrote each of these
residents of Omaha the following letter.

225
00:12:59.450 --> 00:13:01.410
He said, look, here is the name and

226
00:13:01.410 --> 00:13:04.620
address of this doctor
who lives in Boston.

227
00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:08.050
Your job is to get this letter
to this doctor in Boston.

228
00:13:08.050 --> 00:13:12.050
Now, you're not allowed to mail
the letter directly to the doctor.

229
00:13:12.050 --> 00:13:14.840
Instead, you need to mail
it to an intermediary,

230
00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:18.290
someone who you know
on a first name basis.

231
00:13:18.290 --> 00:13:20.190
So of course, if you knew
the doctor on a first name basis,

232
00:13:20.190 --> 00:13:23.160
you could mail it straight to them,
but that was very unlikely.

233
00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:28.370
So what people would do in Omaha is they'd
say, well, I don't know any doctors or

234
00:13:28.370 --> 00:13:31.080
I don't know anyone in Boston, but
at least I know somebody in Pittsburgh.

235
00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:34.400
And at least that's closer to Boston
than Omaha, that's further eastward.

236
00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:37.120
Or maybe someone would say, well, I don't
really know anyone on the east coast but

237
00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:39.420
at least I do know some
doctors here in Omaha.

238
00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:42.410
And so they'd give the letter to
somebody that they knew on a first name

239
00:13:42.410 --> 00:13:43.900
basis in Omaha.

240
00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:45.470
And then the situation would repeat.

241
00:13:45.470 --> 00:13:48.350
Whoever got the letter, again they'd
be given the same instructions.

242
00:13:48.350 --> 00:13:52.020
If you know this doctor in Boston on
a first name basis, send him the letter.

243
00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:57.014
Otherwise, pass the letter on to somebody
who seems more likely closer to them

244
00:13:57.014 --> 00:13:57.930
than you are.

245
00:13:59.870 --> 00:14:04.500
Now, of course, many of these letters
never reach their destination, but

246
00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:07.530
shocking, at least to me,
is that a lot of them did.

247
00:14:07.530 --> 00:14:09.230
So something like 25%, at least,

248
00:14:09.230 --> 00:14:12.970
of the letters that they started
with made it all the way to Boston.

249
00:14:12.970 --> 00:14:16.560
Which I think says something about people
in the late 60s just having more free time

250
00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:19.850
on their hands than they do
in the early 21st century.

251
00:14:19.850 --> 00:14:22.180
I find this hard to imagine,
but it's a fact.

252
00:14:22.180 --> 00:14:26.020
So you had dozens and dozens of letters
reaching this doctor in Boston.

253
00:14:26.020 --> 00:14:30.260
And they were able to trace exactly which
path of individuals the letter went along

254
00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:32.578
before it eventually reached
this doctor in Boston.

255
00:14:32.578 --> 00:14:35.581
And so then what they did is they looked
at the distribution of chain links.

256
00:14:35.581 --> 00:14:39.791
So how many intermediaries were required
to get from some random person in Omaha to

257
00:14:39.791 --> 00:14:41.330
this doctor in Boston?

258
00:14:41.330 --> 00:14:45.500
Some were as few as two, some were as big
as nine but the average number of hops,

259
00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:49.690
the average number of intermediaries, was
in the range of five and a half or six.

260
00:14:49.690 --> 00:14:53.240
And so this is what has given
rise to the colloquialism,

261
00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:57.190
even the name of a popular play,
the six degrees of separation.

262
00:14:57.190 --> 00:14:58.780
So that's the origin myth,

263
00:14:58.780 --> 00:15:03.270
that's where this phrase comes from, these
sort of experiments with physical letters.

264
00:15:03.270 --> 00:15:07.500
But now in network science, the small
world property is meant to be a network.

265
00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:11.305
Which on the one hand is richly connected,
but also in some sense there are enough

266
00:15:11.305 --> 00:15:16.100
cues about which links are likely
to get closer to some target.

267
00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:19.250
So that if you need to route
information from point a to point b,

268
00:15:19.250 --> 00:15:20.970
not only is there a short path,

269
00:15:20.970 --> 00:15:25.980
but if you in some sense follow your nose,
then you'll actually exhibit a short path.

270
00:15:27.610 --> 00:15:31.940
So in some sense, routing information
is easy in small world networks.

271
00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:35.440
Now this is exactly the property
that Broder et al identified

272
00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:37.110
within this giant SCC.

273
00:15:37.110 --> 00:15:40.160
Very rich with short paths, and if you
want to get from point a to point b,

274
00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:41.790
just follow your nose and you'll do great.

275
00:15:41.790 --> 00:15:44.220
You don't need a very sophisticated
shortest path algorithm

276
00:15:44.220 --> 00:15:44.920
to find a short path.

277
00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:48.786
Some of you may have heard
of Sammy Milgram, not for

278
00:15:48.786 --> 00:15:51.317
the small world experiment,
but for another famous, or

279
00:15:51.317 --> 00:15:53.811
maybe infamous experiment
he did earlier in the 60s.

280
00:15:53.811 --> 00:15:58.450
Which consisted into tricking volunteers
into thinking they are subjecting other

281
00:15:58.450 --> 00:16:01.600
human beings to massive
doses of electric shocks.

282
00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:05.438
So that wound up causing a rewrite
to certain standards of ethics in

283
00:16:05.438 --> 00:16:07.090
experimental psychology.

284
00:16:07.090 --> 00:16:10.010
You don't hear about that so much when
people are talking about networks,

285
00:16:10.010 --> 00:16:13.210
but that's another reason why
Milgram's work is well known.

286
00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:15.900
And just as a point of contrast,

287
00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:18.980
outside of this giant strongly connected
component, which has this rich small world

288
00:16:18.980 --> 00:16:22.920
structure, very poor connectivity in
the other parts of the web graph.

289
00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:26.457
So there's lots of cool research going on
these days about the study of information

290
00:16:26.457 --> 00:16:27.727
networks like the web graph.

291
00:16:27.727 --> 00:16:30.496
So I don't want you to get the impression
that the entire interaction

292
00:16:30.496 --> 00:16:33.506
between algorithms and thinking about
information networks has just been

293
00:16:33.506 --> 00:16:36.200
this one strongly connected
component computation in 2000.

294
00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:38.780
Of course,
there's all kinds of interactions.

295
00:16:38.780 --> 00:16:42.560
I've just singled one out that was easy to
explain and also highly intellectual and

296
00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:44.200
interesting back in the day.

297
00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:46.190
But these days, lots of stuff's going on.

298
00:16:46.190 --> 00:16:49.170
People are thinking about
information networks in all kinds of

299
00:16:49.170 --> 00:16:51.940
different ways and of course algorithms,
like in almost everything,

300
00:16:51.940 --> 00:16:53.770
is playing a very fundamental role.

301
00:16:53.770 --> 00:16:57.210
So let me just dash off sort of a few
examples, maybe to whet your appetite.

302
00:16:57.210 --> 00:17:01.679
Maybe you want to go explore this topic
in greater depth outside of this course.

303
00:17:02.950 --> 00:17:04.400
So one super interesting question is,

304
00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:08.050
rather than looking at a static snapshot
of the web, like we were doing so

305
00:17:08.050 --> 00:17:10.700
far in this video,
the web's changing all the time.

306
00:17:10.700 --> 00:17:13.070
New pages are getting created,
new links are getting created and

307
00:17:13.070 --> 00:17:13.960
destroyed and so on.

308
00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:16.720
And how does this evolution proceed?

309
00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:20.640
Can we have a mathematical model,
which faithfully reproduces

310
00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:24.280
the most important first order
properties of this evolutionary process?

311
00:17:25.510 --> 00:17:29.820
So a second issue is to think not just
about the dynamics of the graph itself,

312
00:17:29.820 --> 00:17:33.390
but the dynamics of information
that gets carried by the graph.

313
00:17:33.390 --> 00:17:36.970
And you could ask this both about the web
graph and about other social networks,

314
00:17:36.970 --> 00:17:38.500
like say, Facebook or Twitter.

315
00:17:39.860 --> 00:17:42.680
Another really important topic,
which there's been a lot of work on, but

316
00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:44.970
we still don't fully
understand by any means,

317
00:17:44.970 --> 00:17:48.520
is getting at the finer grain structure
in networks including the web graph.

318
00:17:50.310 --> 00:17:53.560
In particular, what we'd really like
to do is have foolproof methods for

319
00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:55.010
identifying communities.

320
00:17:55.010 --> 00:17:58.230
So groups of nodes, this could either
be webpages in the web graph or

321
00:17:58.230 --> 00:18:02.170
individuals in a social network, which
we should think of as grouped together.

322
00:18:02.170 --> 00:18:05.120
We discussed this a little bit when
we talked about applications of cuts.

323
00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:08.240
One motivation for cuts is to identify
communities, if you think of communities

324
00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:12.420
as being relatively densely connected
inside and sparsely connected outside.

325
00:18:12.420 --> 00:18:14.510
But that's just a baby step.

326
00:18:14.510 --> 00:18:16.390
Really, we need much better techniques for

327
00:18:16.390 --> 00:18:21.230
both defining and computing communities
in these kinds of networks.

328
00:18:22.890 --> 00:18:25.000
So I think these questions
are super interesting,

329
00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:28.530
both from a mathematical/technical level,
but also they're very timely.

330
00:18:28.530 --> 00:18:31.830
Answering them really helps us
understand our world better.

331
00:18:31.830 --> 00:18:34.710
Unfortunately, these are going to
be well outside the course of just

332
00:18:34.710 --> 00:18:37.090
the bread-and-butter design
analysis of algorithms,

333
00:18:37.090 --> 00:18:39.770
which is what I'm tasked
with covering here.

334
00:18:39.770 --> 00:18:43.130
But I will leave you with a reference book
that I recommend if you want to read more

335
00:18:43.130 --> 00:18:44.970
about these topics.

336
00:18:44.970 --> 00:18:47.150
Namely, the quite recent
book by David Easley and

337
00:18:47.150 --> 00:18:49.860
John Kleinberg called Networks,
Crowds, and Markets.
