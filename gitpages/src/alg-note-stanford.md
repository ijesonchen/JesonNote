#  Stanford Algorithm Note

single sorce shortest paths:

# Single Source Shortest Paths

## BFS: Breadth First Search

*Input*

- Directed graph G(V,E), m=|E|, n=|V|
- weight 1 for each edge. i.e. # of edges from s to v
- source vertex s

*Alg*

- FIFO queue
- adjcent matrix

```
BFS(G, s)
	mark s as explored
	Q = FIFO queue, initialized with s
	while Q not empty:
		remove Q.front = v
		for each edge(v,w):
			if w unexplored
				mark w as explored
				add w to Q.end
```

## Dijkstra Algorithm

*Input*

- Directed graph G(V,E), m=|E|, n=|V|
- non negative weight for each edge.
- source vertex s

*Alg*

- greedy chose mininum edge

*T(n)*

- O(mn) with array
- O(m lgn) with heap

## Bellman-Ford Algorithm (W13)

O(EV)

sub-problem: L[i,v] = shortest s-v path with at most i edges. (cycles are permitted.)

```
For i = 1 to n-1
	For each v in V
		A[i,v]		// in-degree(v)
```

$$A[i,v] = min\{A[i-1,v],\ min_{(w,v)\in E}\{A[i-1,w] + c_{w,v}\} \}$$

neg-detect: For all v, all future A[i,v] will be the same.

# All Pair Shortest Paths

## SSSP based

run Dijkstra or Bellman-Ford V times

## Floyd-Warshall Algorithm (w13)

O(n^3)

work with neg length

A[i,j,k]: i-j SP with in first k nodes. (cycle free)

substructure: k is in i-j path ? 

```
Init: A[i,j,0]
	0,	if i = j
	cij, if (i,j) in E
	+âˆž, if i!=j and (i,j) not in E
for k = 1 to n
	for i = 1 to n
		for j = 1 to n
			A[i,j,k] = min{ A[i,j,k-1], A[i,k,k-1]+A[k,j,k-1] }
```



## Johnson's Algorithm

O(mn lgn)





# Minimum Spanning Tree

## Prim's MST algorithm

O(mn) -> O(m lgn)



## Kruskal's MST algorithm



# Dynamic Programming (w12)

## KnapSack (w12)

O(nW)

A[i,x]: best solution uses only first i items & total size less than x

```
Init: A[0,x] = 0
For i = 1 to n
	For x = 0 to W
		A[i,x] = max{ A[i-1,x], A[i-1,x-wi]+vi }
```

## Sequence Alignment (w12)

O(mn)

subproblems: 1) x[m] - y[n] 2) x[m] - gap 3) gap - y[n]

A[i,j]: penalty of optimal alignment of x[i] & y[j]

```
Init: A[i,0] = A[0,i] = i * p(gap)
For i = 1 to m
	for j = 1 to m
		A[i,j]
```

$$A[i,j]=min\{A[i-1,j-1]+p_{x_i,y_j},\ A[i-1,j]+p_{gap},\ A[i,j-1]+p_{gap}\}$$

## Optimal BST (w12)

O(n^3)

Try every possible root, $$C_{i,j}$$ = cost of optimal BST for {i, i+1, ..., j-1, j}. Recurrence
$$C_{i,j}=min_{r=i,\ldots,j}\{\sum_{k=i}^jp_k + C_{i,r-1} + C_{r+1,j}\}$$

```
For s = 0 to n-1	// s=j-i, O(n)
   For i = 1 to n	// O(n)
		A[i,i+s]	// O(n)
```

  $$A[i,i+s] = min_{r=i,\ldots,i+s}\{\sum_{k=i}^{i+s}p_k + A[i,r-1] + A[r+1,i+s]\}$$
